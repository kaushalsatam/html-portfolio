<h1>The Best Movies According to Kaushal</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>Handsdown the best anime of all time.</p>
<h3>Naruto / Naruto Shippuden</h3>
<p>
  Really liked the longitivity of this anime. The roller coaster of emotions is
  just parallel to nothing.
</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>Side characters are the best. Really enjoyed the fighting scenes.</p>
